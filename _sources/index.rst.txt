==================================
SWAP-IT Demonstration Scenario
==================================

The `SWAP-IT architecture <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9926665>`_ was developed as part of the `Fraunhofer lighthouse project SWAP-IT <https://www.produktion.fraunhofer.de/en/research/research-cooperations/lighthouse-projects/swap.html>`_. This new technological concept makes it possible to implement the production of
tomorrow by transforming rigid production environments with individual processing stations into flexible and dynamic production environments. The core of this innovation is a modular cyber-physical production system (CPPS)
that efficiently integrates centralized and decentralized elements as a network of software and mechanical components. The modules are specially designed to adapt seamlessly to different production
environments and can be further developed with minimal effort.

The *Demonstration Scenario* is an example process that is executed within the software modules of the SWAP-It architecture and should server potential users as a first step to get familiar with the SWAP-IT developments and concepts.
In this context, a process to manufacture an industrial traffic light is used as an example. Additional information about the SWAP-IT architecture, the Demonstration scenario and the SWAP-IT software modules can be found in the following sections of this
documentation.


SWAP-IT Architecture
====================

The SWAP-IT architecture introduces a modular, scalable and lightweight architecture utilizing simplified semantic information
models. In general, components of the architecture are split into two types of modules. On the one hand, the *Basic Modules* are the core components of the architecture
by enabling the interaction with the loosely coupled components. All basic components will be published as open source software projects for a simple adaption to enable an automate integration of new processes, based on the
`Production Flow Description Language (PFDL) <https://github.com/iml130/pfdl>`_. On the other hand, *Use Case specific Modules* integrate existing shop floor assets, either physical assets, such as production resources, or non physical assets,
such as optimization approaches to assign jobs to resources. Since these components can vary from production environment to production environment,
the SWAP-IT architecture provides an easy integration mechanism for existing and new assets. As a result, the SWAP-IT architecture enables industrial production environments with a high degrees
of flexibility, easy process integration and in addition, addresses further challenges of production environments, such as an automated
resource parameterization for individual products, or an easy integration of new assets into a shop floor.

For this to be achieved, one process module executes exactly one process that is specified in the PFDL format.
The Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) module is utilized to submit orders and the registry module makes resources available for process agents. Each resource on a shop floor is defined as a SWAP-IT Asset (*Use-Case Specific Modules*). Such assets can easily
be defined by utilizing the SWAP-IT :ref:`Common Information Model` (https://github.com/FraunhoferIOSB/swap-it-common-information-model). As a result, new assets can easily be integrated into the architecture.
An example interaction between the SWAP-IT assets is shown in the sequence diagram below. As starting point, each shop floor *Asset* that should be available for the execution of process steps has to register itself in the *Registry Module*. Here, an arbitrary number of assets, that
are able to execute any given process step, can register themself within the *Registry Module*.
An Process execution starts with the submission of an order from a *Customer*. Afterwards, the *ERP Module* generates the process description (*PFDL*) for the order and transmits it to a *Process Agent*. Within the *Process Agent* the *PFDL Scheduler* interprets
the the PFDL and starts to schedule specified services. Each scheduled service is then transmitted to the *Execution Engine*, which in turn, requests all suitable *Assets* to execute the service from the *Registry Module*. Afterwards, the *Execution Engine* interacts
with an *Assignment Asset* to find the best asset in the context of the specified optimization approach. While these interaction steps are the recommended way to assign a service to an *Asset*, the architecture incorporates additional assignment approaches. Further details
about these approaches can be found in section :ref:`Resource Assignment`. After an *Asset* is found, the *Execution Engine* initiates the service execution on this particular asset and then, returns the service result to the *PFDL Scheduler*. Although the
sequence diagram only displays a single service execution, the *Process Agent* can execute an arbitrary number of process steps until the production process of a product is completed. After the completion of the production process, the *ERP Module* receives a notification from
the *Process Agent* and can inform the customer that the order is completed.

Demonstration Scenario
======================

Demonstration Scenario is an initial application of the SWAP-IT architecture that demonstrates the different software components of the architecture. In this context, the process within the demonstration scenario is constructed to
manufacture an industrial traffic light, with a variable number of light segments. The process is started from the ERP Module, which spawns a process module and generates a PFDL description of the process. This process is then executed by a process
module, that interacts with the shop floor of the scenario. In this context, the shop floor consists of  a Warehouse Module, a Mounting Module, a Gluing Module a Coating Module and a Milling Module. The overall process is illustrated in the figure below. Here,
the manufacturing of the light segments and the manufacturing of the stand segment are defined as parallel subprocesses. Both subprocesses start with the taking of parts from the warehouse. Within the manufacturing of the light segment, a Parallel Loop is deployed
within each of the light segments gets coated in the selected color. After the each light segment is coated, they are glued together. Since the amount of Gluing operations depends on the number of light segments, the Gluing operation is executed within a Loop condition.
As soon as all light segments are glued, this subprocess is completed and the process execution waits until the stand segment's subprocess is completed. Within the stand segment's subprocess a milling operation is performed on the stand segment to shape it in the desired form.
Afterwards, this subprocess is completed and the process execution waits for the compilation of the light segment's subprocess. When both subprocesses are completed, the processes are joined together and the light segments are mounted to the stand segment. Further details about the
process and the according PFDL, the demonstration scenario shop floor configuration and the representation of the resources within the SWAP-IT architecture can be found in section :ref:`Demonstration`.

a docker environment with the Demonstration Scenario is available in this GitHub repository.
To start the application, execute the docker-compose.yml file. More information about the start of the application can be found here :ref:`Start the Patient Zero Docker Application`.
